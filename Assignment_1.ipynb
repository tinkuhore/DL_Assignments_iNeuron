If the input value is greater than or equal to the threshold, the function outputs 1, and if it is less than the threshold, the function outputs 0.

The axon is a long, slender structure that carries electrical signals away from the cell body and transmits them to other neurons or muscle cells. When a neuron receives a sufficient amount of input, it generates an action potential, which is a rapid electrical signal that travels down the axon and triggers the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse, allowing communication between neurons.

This function is particularly useful for training deep neural networks because it helps to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur when using activation functions that saturate and have a small gradient. The ReLU function has a derivative that is either 0 or 1, making it easy to compute during backpropagation. However, one disadvantage of the ReLU function is that it can cause dead neurons, where the neuron outputs 0 for all inputs, during training.
